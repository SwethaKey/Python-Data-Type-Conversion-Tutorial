# DATA TYPE 

# 1)BASIC DATA TYPE                                                
=> Int and Float                                                                          
=> Boolean                                                                             
=> Strings                                                                                 
=> Complex                                                                    
=> NoneType

# 2) ADVANCE DATATYPE(Data Structures)                    
=> List = [ ]                                                                   
=> Tuple = ( )                                                                            
=> Set = { }                                                                                       
=> Dict = { Key : Value }                                        

# 3) CONTROL CONSTRUCTS
               Control Constructs are used a to build/construct the flow control how ever we want
# Conditional Control Construct
=> if 
=> if - else
=> if - elif - else

# Looping Control Construct
=> for : in = not in , is = is not
=> while    

# Jumping Control Construct
=> Continue
=> Break
